Consider an e-commerce platform where a seller can list items and accept orders for his/her
listed items, and customers can order one or more products.
Build a system which should notify the seller about customer orders, and provide a provision to
accept or reject an order. The customer should also be able to check the status of his/her order
e.g. if his/her order has been accepted, rejected, or dispatched.
All customer seller communication should happen using REST APIs.
